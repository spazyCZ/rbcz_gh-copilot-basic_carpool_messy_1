# About - Carpool Parking Reservation System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application designed for managing parking place reservations in a carpool system. The application provides a simple GUI for users to view available parking spaces, create reservations, and manage their bookings while preventing double-booking conflicts.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with Flask-Admin (optional)
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL (to be determined)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login (simple authentication system)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap CSS framework

### Current Architecture

The application currently follows a monolithic architecture with all logic contained in a single file. This approach has several limitations that need to be addressed during the refactoring process.

#### Database Schema (Planned)

        string email
        string password_hash
        datetime created_at
        boolean is_active
    }
    
    ParkingSpaces {
        int id PK
        string space_number
        string location
        boolean is_available
        string description
    }
    
    Reservations {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        int parking_space_id FK
        datetime start_time
        datetime end_time
        string status
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    
    Users ||--o{ Reservations : makes
    ParkingSpaces ||--o{ Reservations : reserved_for
```

   - Session management
   - Basic user roles and permissions

4. **Conflict Prevention**
   - Time slot validation
   - Overlapping reservation detection
   - Automatic availability updates

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Issues

The current codebase (when implemented) will have several critical issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Code Structure Problems**
   - Monolithic design with all logic in one file
   - No separation of concerns
   - Lack of proper blueprints and modular design

2. **Code Quality Issues**
   - Poor variable and function naming conventions
   - Repeated code blocks
   - Mixed presentation and business logic

3. **Security Concerns**
   - No input validation
   - Minimal error handling
   - Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - No CSRF protection

4. **Maintainability Issues**
   - Outdated Flask patterns
   - No unit tests
   - Poor error handling
   - Lack of documentation
