badly written Flask GUI application for parking reservations

Context:
I have a poorly written Flask application with a simple GUI (HTML templates or Flask-Admin) for maintaining reservations of parking places. The code lacks structure, uses poor variable names, mixes logic and presentation, and has minimal error handling. The goal is to review, refactor, and improve this application step-by-step with your help.

Key Features:

List available parking places

Create, update, and delete reservations

Avoid double-booking

Simple authentication (optional)

Code Quality Issues to Address:

Messy code structure (all logic in one file, no blueprints)

Poor variable and function names

Repeated code and no separation of concerns

No input validation or error handling

Outdated Flask patterns (e.g., using Flask extensions poorly)

No tests

Request:

Read through the code and point out the main issues (bad patterns, security risks, maintainability problems, anti-patterns, etc).

Suggest a refactoring plan (high-level steps).

Begin the refactoring process, starting with structuring the codebase and improving the naming and layout.

For each step, explain the changes and why youâ€™re making them.

Intention:
I want to use this as a live exercise for onboarding with Copilot and learning good coding practices in Flask.
